# Cambridge University SpaceFlight - Propulsive Lander - Flight Computer Software

Flight computer software developed on top of ESP-IDF for a liquid fuelled, propulsively landed rocket hopper that flies to 100m and back, to compete in The Lander Challenge.

This version of the software is to be used by a small scale single rotor (with 2 counter-rotating propellers) drone to demonstrate Thrust Vector Control and relevant state estimation and  flight control algorithms. 

The current plan is to implement a Linear Quadratic Regulator for Full State Feedback.
